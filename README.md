# Python Snippets

Welcome to my collection of Python programming snippets! 🐍  
This repository is a personal archive of small, useful, and commonly used Python code blocks that I’ve written or come across during my learning and development journey.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each snippet is saved in its own `.py` file and categorized based on the topic or functionality it covers.

### 📁 Categories (Examples)
- Basics (`variables.py`, `loops.py`, `functions.py`)
- Data Structures (`lists.py`, `dictionaries.py`, `sets.py`)
- File Handling (`read_file.py`, `write_file.py`)
- Object-Oriented Programming (`class_example.py`)
- Algorithms (`sorting.py`, `searching.py`)
- Web Scraping (`requests_example.py`, `beautifulsoup_example.py`)
- Miscellaneous Utilities

> Note: Categories may evolve over time as the repository grows.

## 💻 Requirements

Most of the snippets are compatible with **Python 3.x** and use standard libraries.  
Some may require installing external packages. These will be mentioned in comments within the respective files.

To run a snippet:

```bash
python filename.py
