To create a virtual environment in Python, follow these steps depending on your operating system:

---

### ✅ **1. Open your terminal or command prompt.**

### ✅ **2. Navigate to your project folder** (optional):

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
```

---

### ✅ **3. Create the virtual environment:**

#### On **Windows**, **macOS**, or **Linux**:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

* This creates a folder named `venv` (you can name it anything) that contains the virtual environment.

---

### ✅ **4. Activate the virtual environment:**

#### On **Windows**:

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### On **macOS/Linux**:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

You'll know it's activated when the terminal prompt is prefixed with `(.venv)`.

---

### ✅ **5. Deactivate when you're done:**

```bash
deactivate
```

---
pip install -r requirements.txt
