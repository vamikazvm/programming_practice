    "   - Machine Language (Binary)\n",
    "   - Assembly Language\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **High-Level Languages**\n",
    "   - Python, Java, C++, etc.\n",
    "   - Easier to write, read, and maintain\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Middle-Level Languages**\n",
    "   - Closer to hardware than high-level but more user-friendly than low-level\n",
    "   - Example: C\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scripting Languages**\n",
    "   - Used for automating tasks\n",
    "   - Examples: Python, JavaScript, Perl\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Object-Oriented Languages**\n",
    "   - Based on the concept of objects and classes\n",

    "## 3. How a Python Program Runs\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python source code (`.py`) is written.\n",
    "2. The Python **interpreter** converts it into **bytecode** (`.pyc`).\n",
    "3. The bytecode is sent to the **Python Virtual Machine (PVM)**.\n",
    "4. PVM interprets and executes the code line by line.\n",
